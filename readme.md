# score
| assignment | score | note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| program-assignment-1 | 60% | I am awarding partial credit based on your emailed submission. |
| program-assignment-2 | 88% | Your code looks good, but you failed to address the points about code comments. |
| program-assignment-3 | 100% |  |
| reflection | 32% | Guanhua, this assignment was intended to be written as an APA-formatted, 2-3 page reflection paper, as shown in the assignment. Your several-word answers to the questions in the first section were not sufficient for the assignment. I will give credit for the lambda example. |
